    <h1>making tea</h1>
    <p>The Tea Factory Once the tea leaves have been plucked, they are taken to be processed at a tea factory....
        After the tea leaves have been plucked, the real production of tea begins. The leaves are first taken to a tea factory to be processed.
         These factories are usually very close to the tea gardens, so the leaves stay as fresh as possible.
        There are only 24 hours between the moment the tea leaves are plucked and the minute they're packed up.
         But what happens during these 24 hours is crucial, as this is when the destiny of the leaves will be determined: will they be black,
          green or in-between? Caffeinated or decaff? There's no more important time in a tea leaf's life!</p>

        <p>Tea chemistry is complex. Just how complex? Well, on the bush, tea leaves contain thousands of chemical compounds. When tea leaves are processed, the chemical compounds within them break down,
           form complexes with one another and form new compounds. When steeping tea leaves, our senses are tingled by the thousands of volatile compounds (collectively known as the “aroma complex”) rising from the tea liquor and the thousands of non-volatile compounds that are floating within the tea liquor.
           Because of this, tea is known as the master of chemical diversity.” Much of tea chemistry from field to cup is yet unknown!</p>

        <h3 id="tea processing">tea processing</h3>
        <p>Tea processing is the method in which the leaves from the tea plant Camellia sinensis are transformed into the dried leaves for brewing tea.</p>
        <p>The categories of tea are distinguished by the processing they undergo. In its most general form, tea processing involves different manners and degrees of oxidation of the leaves,
           stopping the oxidation, forming the tea and drying it.</p>
        <p>The innate flavor of the dried tea leaves is determined by the type of cultivar of the tea bush, the quality of the plucked tea leaves, and the manner and quality of the production processing they undergo.
           After processing, a tea may be blended with other teas or mixed with flavourants to alter the flavor of the final tea </p>

        <p>A brief history
           It's claimed that tea most likely originated as a medicinal drink in Yunnan, China, during the Shang Dynasty of 1500 BC – 1046 BC.
           But one popular tea legend suggests that Shennong, Emporor of China and supposed inventor of Chinese medicine,
           discovered tea as a beverage around 2737 BC when fresh tea leaves from a nearby tea tree fell into his cup of just boiled water.
           He thought the beverage to be restorative and encouraged its cultivation as a new, medicinal beverage for his people</p>
        <p>In either origin of tea story, it’s true that as the popularity of the tea beverage grew, not everyone had access to fresh tea leaves to brew, nor would fresh-picked tea leaves stay fresh very long.
           Originally, fresh tea leaves were steamed and compressed into cakes or bricks to dry for easy preservation. The dried tea bricks would then be ground as needed and added to hot water to make a beverage. </p>
        <p>The production, preparation and uses of tea throughout China’s history were known to change over time, however,
           based on the whim and directive of the most current emperor and his dynasty of the time.Eventually,
           tea masters developed various modern tea production methods – like rolling, oxidizing and firing – to make distribution and export more
           manageable and to ensure tea was treated in a way that it could be shipped and stored by both merchants and consumers without fear of spoiling.</p>
