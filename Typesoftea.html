    <h3 id="Black tea">Black tea</h3>
     <p>is the most common type of tea accounting for up to 85% of total tea consumption in the western world.
       Black tea is fully oxidized and has a darker appearance, stronger flavour, and higher caffeine content compared to other teas.
       The caffeine content in black tea is still around half the level of coffee. Often black teas can be consumed with sugar, milk,
       or lemon and offer some of the same health benefits as other teas.</p>
     <p>Black tea, also translated to red tea in various Asian languages, is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas.
       Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis.</p>
     <p>Two principal varieties of the species are used – the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis), used for most other types of teas,
       and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced</p>
     <p>First originating in China, the beverage's name there is hong cha (Chinese: 紅茶, "red tea") due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately.
       Today, the drink is widespread throughout East and Southeast Asia, both in consumption and harvesting, including in Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Singapore. Similar variants are also available in South Asian countries.</p>
     <p>While green tea usually loses its flavor within a year, black tea retains its flavor for several years. For this reason, it has long been an article of trade,
       and compressed bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century</p>

    <h3 id="green tea">green tea</h3>
    <p>is 'unoxidized' tea. The leaves are heated soon after picking in order to destroy the enzymes that cause oxidation.
       This type of processing preserves a high level of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals accounting for the various health benefits of green tea.
       The infusion is pale greenish-yellow in color and tastes light and grassy. It is best consumed without any additives, although some people may prefer to add lemon or a sweetener but not milk</p>
    <p>is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas.
       Green tea originated in China, and since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East and Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.
       Although there has been considerable research on the possible health effects of consuming green tea regularly, there is little evidence that drinking green tea has any effects on health.</p>

    <h3 id="oolong tea">oolong tea</h3>
    <p>is semi-oxidized, so the leaf is allowed to sit for maybe 2-4 hours, before being heated up to halt oxidization.
       The amount of oxidation affects the flavour and appearance of the tea. Longer oxidization results in a darker oolong which is more similar in taste to a black tea,
       while shorter oxidization makes it more similar in nature to green tea. When steeped, Oolong tea produces golden or light brown tea with a very delicate flavour resembling neither black nor green tea.</p>
    <p>Oolong ( /ulʊŋ, -lɒŋ/; simplified Chinese: 乌龙茶; traditional Chinese: 烏龍茶 (wūlóngchá, "dark dragon" tea)) is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a process including
       withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting. Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties.
       The degree of oxidation, which varies according to the chosen duration of time before firing, can range from 8 to 85%,depending on the variety and production style. Oolong is especially popular in south China and among 
       Chinese expatriates in Southeast Asia as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony.</p>
    <p> Different styles of oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, or woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with complex aromas,
        all depending on the horticulture and style of production Several types of oolong tea, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas.
        Different varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are usually formed into one of two distinct styles. Some are rolled into long curly leaves, while others are 'wrap-curled' into small beads, each with a tail. The former style is the more traditional.</p>

    <h3 id="White tea">White tea</h3>
    <p> is the least processed of all teas. Only the unopened buds and young leaves covered in silver fuzz are used, and they are merely withered and dried.
        White tea produces a very light-colored infusion with a mild flavour. Its caffeine content is even lower than that of green tea and is considered to have a very high level of antioxidants.
        White tea is best consumed without any additives at all.</p>
    <p>Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white tea and very little international agreement; some sources use the term to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing,
       some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly before the buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry in natural sun,[citation needed] while others include tea buds 
       and very young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying. Most definitions agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized[citation needed], resulting in a flavor characterized as "lighter" than most green or traditional black teas.
    </p>
    <p>In spite of its name, sweet, brewed white tea is pale yellow. Its name derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which give the plant a whitish appearance.
       The unopened buds are used for some types of white tea.</p>

    <h3 id="Maghrebi mint tea">Maghrebi mint tea</h3>
    <p>Maghrebi mint tea (Moroccan Arabic: أتاي, romanized: atay; Arabic: الشاي المغربي بالنعناع, romanized: aš-šhāy al-maghrebi bin-na'nā';Berber languages: ⴰⵜⴰⵢ, romanized: atay), also known as Moroccan mint tea,
       is a green tea prepared with spearmint leaves and sugar. Spread from Morocco, it is traditional to the Greater Maghreb region (the northwest African countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania).
       Its consumption has spread throughout North Africa, parts of the Sahel, France, Arab world, and Middle East. It is most closely associated with Morocco and in Spanish is known simply as "Moorish tea", té moruno.
       A similar drink is prepared in Spain but is typically served chilled as iced tea in the summer, instead of hot year-round.</p>
    <p>Mint tea is central to social life in the Maghreb. The serving can take a ceremonial form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality.
       Typically, at least three glasses of tea are served.The tea is consumed throughout the day as a social activity. The native spearmint naʿnāʿ (نعناع) possesses a clear, pungent, mild aroma, and is the mint that is traditionally used in Maghrebi mint tea. 
       Other hybrids and cultivars of spearmint, including yerba buena, are occasionally used as substitutes for Nana mint. In Morocco, mint tea is sometimes perfumed with herbs, flowers, or orange blossom water. In the cold season, they add many warming herbs like pennyroyal mint and wormwood.</p>
