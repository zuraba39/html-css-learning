    <h1>production</h1>
    <p>Tea is mainly grown in Asia and Africa. In South America and around the Black and Caspian Seas tea is also grown.
       The four biggest tea-producing countries are China, India, Kenya and Sri Lanka. Together they represent 75% of world production of tea.
       However, its production can also be found in such places as São Miguel Island, Azores, in Portugal, and Guria, in Georgia, which are part of Europe.
       In 2019, global production of tea was 6.5 million tonnes, led by China with 43% and India with 22% of the world total. Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam were secondary producers.</p>

    <p>tea production, cultivation of the tea plant, usually done in large commercial operations. The plant, a species of evergeen (Camellia sinensis), is valued for its young leaves and leaf buds,
       from which the tea beverage is produced. This article treats the cultivation of the tea plant. For information on the processing of tea and the history of its use, see the article tea.</p>  
    <p>Varieties
        The natural habitat of the tea plant is considered to be within the fan-shaped area between the Nagaland, Manipur, and Lushai hills along the Assam-Myanmar (Burma) frontier in the west;
        through to China, probably as far as Zhejiang province in the east; and from this line south through the hills of Myanmar and Thailand into Vietnam. The three main varieties of the tea plant, China, Assam, and Cambodia,
        each occur in their most distinct form at the extremes of the fan-shaped area. There are an infinite number of hybrids between the varieties; such crosses can be seen in almost any tea field.</p>
